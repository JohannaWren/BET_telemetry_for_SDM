# BET telemetry SDM
Repository containing code for extracting tracks from WC and Lotek archival and pop-off tags. Animal tracks will be used in an SDM which will be projected forward to look at effects of climate change on species distrubutions. 

Through a large collaboration, telemetry tags are shared by SPC, IATTC, HIMB, and other partners and re-analyzed using a consistent protocol. Lotek and Wildlife Computer tags are processed for basic locations using DAP and GPE2 respectively, then a Kalman filter processing is done using UKFSST in R.
